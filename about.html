            My name is Tiago Santos and I was born in a small city named Braga, 
            Portugal. I developed a passion for graphic design and arts, as I 
            desired to reflect the beauty of Portugal's people and culture
            through my artwork. From the beginning of my journey as an artistic 
            designer, I have created artwork that gave rise to my passion for 
            digital work. I have studied in the Master of Technology and Digital 
            Art at the University of Minho in Braga. My professional expertise 
            is in animation, illustration, and drawing. I also have experience 
            with typography, photo manipulation, photo retouching and video 
            editing.I have helped many clients with logo and identity design, 
            signage,  publications, layout, and package design. 
            You can check out my Work  pages and links to review some of my client 
            projects as well as personal projects.

          <h3>Designer</h3>
          <h6>Graphics</h6>
          <p>
            My journey as Graphic started early when I first engage a 3 years
            course in Coimbra, Art and Design. As Graphic designer and Artist I
            worked with both text and images. I managed to select the type,
            font, size, color, and line length of headlines, headings, and text.
            Also I decide how images and text will go together on a print or
            webpage, including how much space each will have. When using text in
            layouts, I collaborate closely with writers who choose the words and
            decide whether the words will be put into paragraphs, lists, or
            tables. Through the use of images, text, and color, I am able to
            transform statistical data into visual graphics and diagrams, which
            can make complex ideas more accessible. I worked for a typography
            Rolsaco 2018 where my main job was creating business cards, flyers
            and posters.

          <h3>Programmer</h3>
          <h6>Front End Developer</h6>
          <p>
            As a student from the Master Programme in Technology and Digital Art
            (MTAD) of the EEUM I ve been part of the organised exhibition "Media
            & Digital Art Exhibition", on the 17th and 18th June of 2016, at the
            Couros Campus of the University of Minho in Guimarães. The event was
            realised aiming at opening campus’ doors to the community and at
            presenting the work completed in the context of the several
            curricular units during the 1st year of the programme. The art
            installations exposed in this exhibition were an example of the
            result of the skills acquired during the master programme and the
            collaboration between the group of students which, during this
            academic year, are from backgrounds as diverse as Engineering and
            Management Information Systems, Computer Science, Product Design,
            Design and Multimedia, Biomedical Engineering, Theatre and Applied
            Languages. The exhibition comprised works that explored concepts of
            interactivity, electronic music, sound design, 3D animation, game
            design, sensors and computer vision, in order to create
            installations with aesthetic value.

          <h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
          <h6>User Interaction</h6>
          <p>
            My first experience as Ux/UI Designer was also at the master program
            I was enrolled in. I have done mockups for User Interface Layout,
            studied about Personas and also created the User Experience
            Interface for small mobile application. In 2017 I was part of an
            internship at a company in Brasil with the name of Instituto Stela
            and there I was responsible for the designing of a mobile
            application for mac and android. That application worked on the
            concept of the firm website, which the aim was provide a search for
            helping universities and the Employers finding the best candidate
            for the instituition. The name of the platform was Lattes developed
            by the firm, but the mobile app I was prototyping was MyRate.
